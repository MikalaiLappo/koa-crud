## why this code bad
1. No actual interfaces nor IoC - the code is rigid, not testable, and defeating the Open-Closed principle
2. No SQL type-safety
3. Seems to have some structure, but it doesn't really align with any meaningful pattern or architecture

It was written in a night for a job application requiring Koa.js and plain SQL. Getting a random star on it makes me feel guilty :p
